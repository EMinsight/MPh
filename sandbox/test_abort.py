"""
Tests if `KeyboardInterrupt` exception are properly handled.

This test currently fails. That is, trying to interrupt an ongoing
operation of the Comsol client crashes out of the Python session
instead of allowing further code execution or a return to the
interactive prompt.

The script does not depend on MPh, but starts the Comsol client
directly via the Java bridge JPype. Paths to the Comsol installation
are hard-coded for a Windows installation of Comsol 5.6. Other versions
or install locations can be tested by editing the assignment to the
`root` variable. On Linux, 'win64' has to be replaced by 'glnxa64',
and on macOS by 'maci64'.
